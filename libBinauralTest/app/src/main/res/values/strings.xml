    <string name="tut4_1">Binaural Beats</string>
    <string name="tut4_2">Binaural beats are auditory processing artifacts, or apparent sounds, the perception of which arises in the brain for specific physical stimuli. By playing 2 slightly different frequencies on the left and right channel, the brain produces a third tone, which frequency is the difference between the 2 frequencies. The effect on the brainwaves depends on the difference in frequencies: for example, if 220 Hz was played in one ear and 230 in the other, then the binaural beat would have a frequency of 10 Hz. These beats can be used for many different things: meditation, improving memory and attention, curing epilepsy, simulating the effects of recreational drugs and many others. Binaural beats have been proven to be completely harmless. However, some individuals may have seizures. For this reason, if you have any familiar who suffers from epilepsy or similar conditions, you should consult your medic before using this software. In order to use binaural beats, you need stereo headphones, and some peace and quiet while you\'re listening to the preset: if something interrupts you, the effect of the beats will wear off almost immediately. Once you made sure that nobody can nag you, put on your headphones, get comfortable, press play and focus on the beats. Do not get scared from the sensations that the beats may cause, or you will \'wake up\' and have to do that all over. It may take some practice.</string>
